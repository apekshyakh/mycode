I put most of the code in one module. I will split it out if it gets used in other applications

For example I have code that is used by the API service and a worker behind the API I will split that code out so it can be shared.

Good example would be database code.

Most of the time I will split it out later once it become apparent that it will need to be used in multiple places

The best guidance on how to structure code should come from the zen of python https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
